<div class="contentinner"><p>My name is Evan, and my wife Jasmin and I own and operate Crum Design Group, a family business that offers Residential Design & Drafting Services to clients throughout North Metro Atlanta.

I’ve always had a love and an appreciation for the science and art behind a well-orchestrated residential design. I am deeply motivated to find the right solution for each individual, whether that's accomplished by crafting a bespoke floor plan tailored to your unique needs and values, shaping that “missing puzzle piece” addition to your home, or formulating a renovation that finds the hidden gem of potential beneath the façade of a tired and outdated space. That love is what led me to pursue my degree in Architectural Drafting & Design. It is also what has guided me through my various professional roles in Land Surveying, Civil Engineering, Architectural Design, and Construction Procurement over the past decade. I’ve worked for small and large firms, on commercial and residential projects, and on both the east and west coasts, which has provided me exposure to nearly every aspect of residential design from the rezoning and subdividing of a large tract of land to designing and fabricating custom railing infill panels. My goal is to package all of those experiences and methodologies together to provide you with a holistic solution that considers and accounts for aesthetics, function, cost, and timing. I consider it a privilege to learn something new about this profession every day.
    
I would be truly honored if you would be willing to share your design challenges with me so that we can collaborate and find a solution that meets your particular needs while also adding joy and beauty to your world.</p></div>
